# JIRA for Management to Development

## JIRA Workflow
### Epics
Understand the product and your place in it as an individual. These tickets should written for individuals to understand the companies goals and their part in it.  
→ Importance: Descriptions
#### Stories
Feature in this piece of the Epic
- Time for deadlines in the Project Roadmap
- Actual dates and times. Story points are fun but not helpful understand real deadlines
#### Tasks
Smaller chunks of the story
- How to do them and break the story into pieces
- Adequate with time in actual time with timestamps (do this in story points actually) 
- Developers should pick their own points in sprint planning
- Adjust times with actual work because people
- People that have deadlines to accomplish should stay working until it’s done.
- Understanding what time sets they can accomplish in a sprint will become relevant 
#### Bug Reports
To best help a developer understand the problem at hand. Before getting started with work. To stop future breaks in the codebase because of developers panicking to get something done.
- Discussions: If we are not sure if something is truly a bug in the code but possibly an issue that requires investigation and not writing code
- Hot-fixes: For patching production for current bugs, these should get the main priority before continuing with roadmap tasks
- Maintenance: This can be a story broke up into tasks. My personal opinion is that they should written that way to start. So it's a bug for a reminder of how to write code. For quality standards
    - Refactors
        - Readability: Clean readable code for anyone to go in and understand it. Use code documentation has needed for any developer at a immediate level for understanding.
        - Optimization: Time complexity and bonus features for the work that's been created
### Priorities
What's important now then meeting things pretty. Functionality comes first but the other tickets are required. If late it is always possible to ship the functionality then update the aesthetics in hot-fixes.
## Environments
### Applications
Production employees don't work in the same environments as engineers of any kind. Developers work in their local machines and less in application. While production employees only work in application. To connect two worlds, a Jira Desktop application or Client is the best solution. Make sure they work for any type of operating system. Mac/Linux/Windows. These should be installed previously or with new updates to preexisting machines. Root access should stay the same to not restrict the application on the device. If the old ways worked for them, someone clearly doesn't want the ease and comfort of staying in their locals and working with ease and unity. Calendars, Emails, and any other applications that people need but shouldn't have to consider themselves too much on should be given in easy ways. 
Pick any suitable application in the Marketplace or make your own but these are some tools that may help:
#### Outlook
Application for all applications, the security is set in Outlook. The limitation is Outlook itself:

Configurations
- Device level: Jira Client
- Workflow level: Jira configurations for teams at any level
- Production management: All is given in Jira by default however the notifications for teams to gather are nice
## Confluence
Set levels of importance. Show notifications for the right levels. And organized the documentation at any level required. The levels in mind are:
- Team Oriented
- Production Management
- Scrub Masters
Set the level of understanding that is needed for the work to make sense and understand the main objective that needs to set. Use notifications for updates or creation and required contribution (Put it in the documentation itself "In Progress", "Need Assistance", "Is There Anything Missing")
Unity
This brings all types of employees together. The size of the company will have to scale differently. As the company grows so does the information needed. The amount of information that is needed is always: "What's the company's goals, where do I fit in them, and what is my part in achieving them". Manipulation is not the answer. Quality control is. Unity is made when everybody is working cohesively. The amount of information that is shared is amount to control but dangerous to be controlling. Employees should maintain good health, stay stable, and live health lives at a company for sustainability at a company. This can help with teams collaborating together in a safe environment to work in.
